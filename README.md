# Epicycle-Lecture
In the Hipparchian, Ptolemaic, and Copernican systems of astronomy, the epicycle (meaning circle moving on another circle) was a geometric model used to explain the variations in speed and direction of the apparent motion of the Moon, Sun, and planets. In particular it explained the apparent retrograde motion of the five planets known at the time. Secondarily, it also explained changes in the apparent distances of the planets from the Earth. (Wikipedia)

As a part of this lecture, I'll demonstrate the epycycles model with the Manim library (Python library for creating explanatory math videos).
